# Enhanced Headers
A Drupal 9 theme that modifies the h1 element. The theme uses CSS to modify the h1 element such that it flashes every two seconds and inverts its colors on hover.

## Installation
To install the theme, place the `enhanced_headers` folder in the `docroot/themes/` or `docroot/themes/custom/` directory. If the downloaded/cloned repo contains the branch name (ex: `enhanced_headers-master`), rename the file to `enhanced_headers`.

## Future-proofing
The theme extends the base theme `classy`, but it does not require modification of the Drupal `core` libraries. Additionally, it specifies a `core_version_requirement` of `9^`.
